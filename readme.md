# Bi-Directional Charger Buss

Calculate cost of cables and electronics for a Bi-Directional Charger System with multiple Vehicles. 

## Introduction

This code provides a template to calculate installation costs, power throughput and losses based on charger power, number of vehicles, voltages etc.

## Instructions

The codes works as the the image that follows. It uses, as in the example, 3 DC busses, which are then converted to a higher DC-level, which can then be inverted towards a grid, or connected straight to a battery.
